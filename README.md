# Intersection Lines
## Geometry Library (C++)

Library for working with 2D/3D vectors and a solution to the problem of intersection of lines.

- Implementation of the classes `Vector2`, `Vector3` and `Line`.
- Operations: addition, normalization, scalar/vector product.
- Finding the intersection point of lines in 2D and 3D.
